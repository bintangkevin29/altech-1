# Altech Test 1

## Installation

### `yarn start`
### `yarn Build`

## Packages Used
 - `create-react-app` for bootstrapping React project
 - `node-sass` for sass utilization
 - `react-router-dom` for SPA routing solution

## What Could be Improved 

This projects are done within my tight schedule, even so I still tried to do my best. There are some that I could've done better more time is given

- Loading component, I could've built a function that mock an api fetch with Promise as return value, then utilize the loading component when fetching was on process.
- Error component
- Page responsiveness
